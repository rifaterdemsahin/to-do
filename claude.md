## 🗺 Project Self-Learning System — 7-Stage Journey

### Stage Overview: Unknown → Proven

| Stage | Folder | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1 | `1_Real_Unknown` | **The "Why"** — Problem definitions, OKRs, core questions |
| 2 | `2_Environment` | **The "Context"** — Roadmaps, constraints, setup guides |
| 3 | `3_Simulation` | **The "Vision"** — UI mockups, image carousel |
| 4 | `4_Formula` | **The "Thinking & Planning"** — LLM reasoning logs, decisions, research, recipes |
| 5 | `5_Symbols` | **The "Reality"** — Core source code, implementation |
| 6 | `6_Semblance` | **The "Scars"** — Error logs, workarounds, gap analysis |
| 7 | `7_Testing_Known` | **The "Proof"** — Validation, checklists, outcome confirmation |

## 🛠 Core Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Static Hosting:** GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
- **Secrets Management:** Azure Key Vault (never commit secrets to git)
- **AI Stack:** Qdrant + Ollama (`nomic-embed-text`, 4096 dimensions)
- **Deployments:** Fly.io — container-based (Docker) Python service deployments
- **Database:** Supabase — managed Postgres, auth, realtime, storage, `pgvector`
- **Server-Side Logs:** Axiom — centralized structured logging, tracing, alerting
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

> 📋 See [`2_Environment/tools.md`](2_Environment/tools.md) for a single overview of every tool in the stack.

### Navigation & UI Rules

**Two menus required:**

1. **Project Menu** (always visible) — Links and functionality for the project being delivered. This is what end-users see.
2. **Debug Menu** (hidden by default) — All delivery-pilot-template framework links (7 stages, agent files, tools). Only shown when the user clicks the **debug button** at the **bottom-right corner** of the page.

**Menu behavior:**
- Debug button is always visible at bottom-right (small icon, e.g., bug/gear)
- Clicking debug button toggles the Debug Menu on/off
- Debug mode persists via `debug=true` cookie
- Both menus use Flexbox/Grid, responsive, and read from JSON config
- Search with autocomplete in the Debug Menu
- No direct link to `markdown_renderer.html`

### Social Links (required in `index.html`)
- GitHub Repository link
- LinkedIn: [rifaterdemsahin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rifaterdemsahin/) 🔗
- YouTube: [@RifatErdemSahin](https://www.youtube.com/@RifatErdemSahin) 📺

## 🤖 Claude-Specific Instructions

### Behavior Guidelines
- Always follow the 7-stage structure when creating or organizing content
- When adding files, place them in the appropriate numbered folder
- **After every command, commit and push** — do not batch changes; each step gets its own commit. If any git errors occur, proactively troubleshoot and resolve them.
- Use emojis (✨, 🛠, 🧪, 🐛) for scannability
- **Record every prompt** in `prompts.md` — log date, agent, and purpose for each prompt given
- **README.md must include the public GitHub Pages URL** — e.g., `https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/<repo-name>/` (see [proxmox example](https://rifaterdemsahin.github.io/proxmox/))
- **Keep `index.html` at the repo root** — GitHub Pages requires it at the root for the site to work
- **Active Reflection Routine** — Write a short "retrospective journal" in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md` after every milestone.
- **Keep Debug Menu Config Synchronized** — When markdown files are added, modified, or deleted in any stage, remember to update the debug menu configuration (`navigation_config.json` and the fallback arrays in `index.html` and `markdown_renderer.html`) to reflect these changes immediately.
- **Architecture Documentation Sync** — When the system architecture changes, immediately update the architecture overview document at `2_Environment/architecture.md` (with updated Mermaid diagrams) to keep it working.
- **Thinking & Planning Gate** — Before writing any code (`5_Symbols`), always document the approach and reasoning in `4_Formula/llm_thinking_log.md`. After execution, append a summary of the LLM reasoning process. `4_Formula` is the mandatory planning stage that encapsulates thinking before action.
- **Error & Fix Logging** — When any error occurs, append an entry to `6_Semblance/error.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [SEVERITY] — Description`). When a fix is applied, append to `6_Semblance/fix.log` (format: `[DATE] [STAGE] [STATUS] — Fix description`) with status `APPLIED`. After validation in `7_Testing_Known`, update the status to `VERIFIED`. Capture learnings in `6_Semblance/lessons_learned.md`.

### Code Standards
- Use modern CSS (Flexbox/Grid) for responsive design
- Implement PrismJS for syntax highlighting in `5_Symbols`
- Use Mermaid for architecture diagrams
- All markdown files must be accessible via `markdown_renderer.html`

### Lifecycle Management
- Move obsolete files to `_obsolete/` sub-folder within their directory 🚮
- Every folder must have a Testing Checklist with an embedded YouTube video

### Secrets & Environment
- Use Azure Key Vault for all secrets — enterprise-grade security at low cost with pay-per-operation pricing
- Create a matching Key Vault per environment (dev/staging/prod) in Azure Portal
- Never push secrets to GitHub
- Reference `.env.example` for required variables

#### Why Azure Key Vault?
- **Security:** FIPS 140-2 validated HSMs, RBAC + access policies, automatic key rotation, audit logs via Azure Monitor
- **Low cost:** ~$0.03/10,000 operations (Standard tier); free tier available for dev/test; no per-seat licensing
- **Compliance:** Meets SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, GDPR requirements out of the box
- **Integration:** Native GitHub Actions support via `azure/login` + `Azure/get-keyvault-secrets`; works with Fly.io via env vars

### 📋 Error Tracking Workflow
When errors occur, use this skill chain:
1. Log to `6_Semblance/error.log` → root cause in `gap_analysis.md`
2. Apply fix → log to `6_Semblance/fix.log` with status `APPLIED`
3. Run `/verify` to confirm fix in browser
4. Run `/code-review` on the diff
5. Commit → update `fix.log` status to `VERIFIED`
6. Retrospective → append to `lessons_learned.md`
